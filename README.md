## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The usage of a container, allowed me to easily set a baseline and control the layout of the overall page. This made it easier for me to center everything as compared to how I originally attempted to do so.

```css
.container {
  max-width: 360px;
  margin: 75px auto;
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [CSS Reference](https://cssreference.io/) - This site helped me by refreshing me on the usage of various css attributes and properties.
